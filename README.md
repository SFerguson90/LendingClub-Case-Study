LendingClub: From the Beginning

This is an example for Mouhamadou

## Overview and Origin

* Name of company
	For this FinTech case study, the company I will be reviewing is LendingClub.

* When was the company incorporated?
	LendingClub was founded in 2006 but really began to take off in 2007.

* Who are the founders of the company?
	The founder of LendingClub is Renaud Laplanche. While there were private investors, who helped get LendingClub off the ground, Laplanche was the founding CEO.

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?
	The founder of LendingClub coined the idea, while he was speaking with friends and family, who said they would have bankrolled his business with less draconian terms than his credit cards. Laplanche recognized that banks were, essentially, middlemen.

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?
	The company was originally funded in 2007, when it raised “$10.26 million in a Series A funding round in August from Norwest Venture Partners and Canaan Partners.” Subsequently, LendingClub received $12M in Series B funding in 2009, which was led by Morgenthaler Ventures and joined by Norwest Venture Partners and Canaan Partners. LendingClub received $24.5M Series C funding in 2010, led by Foundation Capital and joined by Morgenthaler Ventures, Norwest Venture Partners, and Canaan Partners. LendingClub raised another $25M in Series D, led by Union Square Ventures in 2011. Since 2011 and their Series rounds, they have raised more than a billion dollars from their IPO, a stake with Google, and other private equity investors.

## Business Activities:

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?
	LendingClub aims to eliminate the use of a banker as a middleman for a loan, by having private investors provide fund the borrowers. The borrowers, in return, make monthly payments directly to those investors. LendingClub makes money through distribution and origination fees for investors and borrowers, respectively. 

* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
	Because the company makes money from the fees charged to investors and borrowers alike, those are their intended customers. According to CNBC, as of February 2019, the market in the US for personal loans was $138 billion dollars. (Rooney 2019 https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/21/personal-loans-surge-to-a-record-138-billion-in-us-as-fintechs-lead-new-lending-charge.html) 

*What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)
	Lending Club’s competitive advantage comes from being able to offer cheaper loans to it’s customers, fractional investing to it’s investors, and better returns for investors. LendingClub utilizes lower overhead costs to offer cheaper loans to customers, which makes it more attractive on that end. Investors, large and small alike, can invest as little as $25 into a specific loan. This makes their service more inclusive to beginner or low-income investors. Lower-income investors can buy fractional shares of debtor’s loans, and still receive the same percentage return.

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stack Share to find this information.)
	LendingClub does not have a presence on Stack Share and does not have an engineering blog. We could assume they are using the most common stacks, which other companies would also be using. These could include jQuery, Bootstrap, Django, and React.


## Landscape:

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?
	LendingClub is in the lending domain of the finance industry.

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?
	Over the last five to ten years, the industry has become more inclusive of who its investors can be and to whom it lends money. As of late, with recent financial developments, they have restricted lending to debtors of financial scores over 600. This is to insure the stability of the company. The major trend, which this company took advantage of, was getting rid of the banking middleman and making the service peer-to-peer or P2P.

* What are the other major companies in this domain?
	Other major companies in this domain include Realty Shares, which was recently acquired by a separate company. LendingTree was another similar company of similar origins.


## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?
	The business impact of this company has been a wider range of investor activity and lending capabilities to those in need.

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?
	The metrics of success for this company include average percent return, completion of debts, number of debts issued, quality of debts, and overall monetary return in the market. This helps to measure the quality of the loans and the performance of the investors, which helps the company to make money on fees. 

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?
	The domain is far from saturated, so the company is doing very well. There aren’t as many well-known competitors with this specific focus. While major banks like Bank of America, Chase, and Wells Fargo continue to issue loans, LendingClub is cornering this specific market.


## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers. Use your imagination!)
	I would suggest that they offer more data analytics. Their site offers useful charts and information, but providing that information in a more visual manner would be more attractive to investors and debtors alike.

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
	By visualizing data, investors may be keener and more open to investing their money with this company. It is easy to type out that you can earn 10% on your investment annually for 20 years but showing a steep graph and visualizing the result is much more appealing.

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
	This additional product and service would utilize the simplicity of the NumPy and Seaborn module in Python, which it could use to make the graphs and apply them to the code of the website.

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
	These technologies are appropriate to my solution, because NumPy, along with Pandas, would help to calculate numbers from data frames or excel spreadsheets, while Seaborn could turn that data into visualized graphs.
